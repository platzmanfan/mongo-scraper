# mongo-scraper application

- First application i created using mongoose and scraping from a website!!!

This application can scrape upon clicking a website that we previously choosed and go find those elements in the html and get the info we needed!!! 

We can achieve this with cheerio and axios allow us to make http request!!

I used mongoose to create my own database that i can populate whatvere it's scraped into the database and show it to page!!!


### Technologies i used for creating this app:

- mongoose
- axios 
- express
- express handlebars
- cheerio
